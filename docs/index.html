        <h3 align="middle">Project Summary</h3>
        <p> Virtual reality is becoming a more prominent technology in modern society. For our final project, 
            we would like to attempt to explore this field by implementing the rendering and lighting techniques 
            that have been taught in class in a 3D explorable space. We aim to implement this on an accessible tool, 
            our smartphone, and possibly introduce interactivity through the Google Cardboard API.
        </p>
        
        <h3 align="middle">Problem Description</h3>
        So far, the concepts we've learned in class have been applied on 3D objects, but on a static 2D screen. We 
        are wondering how that changes if we render whole environments in the virtual space, as well as have our eyes 
        as the camera that views the scene. This inherently involves some complexity, as our eyes are mobile and thus, the 
        rendered scene changes in some ways during the viewing process. However, since VR is becoming an increasingly 
        popular technology in the tech space, we'd like to try our hand at porting our learning to this technology. 

        <h3 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h3>
        Our ultimate goal is to produce a VR app for iOS/Android devices that is compatible with the Google Cardboard system. 
        Our app will take a scene (we have not decided yet whether the scene will be imported as an image of a real world environment, 
        or a rendered, polygonal mesh) and apply realistic graphics effects (mainly lighting) for viewing by an audience. Our deliverables 
        include the creation of the scene to be rendered, a basic app that allows said scene to be rendered for static viewing on the phone, and 
        an app that allows said scene to be viewed in full 3D VR on the phone. We also aim to provide interactive features, by allowing the camera 
        to teleport around the scene, as our final expected deliverable. Additional features may be implemented as time permits, but due to the 
        radical nature of this project to us (none of us have experimented with VR or any of its related APIs/CDKs before), we expect 
        to have slightly more complications and debugging issues than usual.<br>
        As an addition, we will probably discover additional SDKs/APIs while in the research phase of our project. Thus, we may switch the used 
        SDK in order to improve performance or implement new features. As of submission of this proposal, our group is planning to research the 
        Google VR suite (Daydream, Cardboard) and the Unity3D XR tutorial program. We may include more as time goes on.

        <h3 align="middle">Schedule</h3>
        <h4>WEEK 1: RESEARCH</h4>
        <p>This week will be dedicated to becoming familiar with the needed packages and APIs. For this, 
            we will brush up on the rendering algorithms needed, the Unity workspace, and the Google Cardboard SDK 
            used in Unity. We will also look at videos that describe implementing VR scenes in Unity and Google 
            Cardboard.
        </p>
        <h4>WEEK 2: IMPLEMENT</h4>
        <p>The bulk of implementing our project is planned to happen during this week. Goals include creating 
            the scene, programming the bulk of the code that allows a basic rendering of our image, and porting 
            a rudimentary app to the phone for testing. We aim to have a simple app that at least allows a user 
            to be immersed in a simply rendered environment which may be lit.
        </p>
        <h4>WEEK 3: DEBUG</h4>
        <p>We allow a week in our schedule to be used for debugging the previous code and finishing up any implementation 
            details that were left unfinished. This includes finishing the targeted lighting algorithms, improving performance 
            of the application, and including rudimentary interactivity (using the Google Cardboard button to allow scene changes, 
            as an example). We expect things to be rough as we are working with an API that is new to all of us, so 
            this week will also be used to do more research in case those unfamiliarities cause issues in our project.
        </p>
        <h4>WEEK 4: EXTEND</h4>
        <p>This final week serves as a buffer to make sure, at the very least, we have an app that renders virtual environments with 
            the realistic rendering algorithms from class. However, assuming the past 3 weeks are followed in full, this week 
            will also be dedicated to extending our app to include more functional and enjoyable features. We plan on expanding 
            the working environment that we render (possibly to include animated materials), as well as including interactive features 
            such as further increasing the use of Google Cardboard's button. In the case that we go the complete virtual route, we are thinking 
            of implementing a "tour on rails" through the environment. In the case that we instead render a 3D image of a photographed 
            environment, we will instead explore implementing mixed reality interactions (provided by Unity XR tutorials).
